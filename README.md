# HappyLand Holiday Resort website
This is a basic website for the Happy Land Holiday Resort, allowing end-users to learn more about us and what we have to offer, as well as make online reservations at the resort.

## Technology and tools 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Visual studio code

## Challenges :
I was only recently exposed to javascript, so I believe that incorporating it into my website was a bit of a challenge. However, it was a great opportunity for me to learn more and explore javascript.

## Features i would like to implement in the future :
A gallery page where users can automatically upload all the images they took at our resourt, these images should automacally expire after 30 days to make room for all our guests who'd like to share their experiences.
